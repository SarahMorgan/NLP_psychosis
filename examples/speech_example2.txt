Oh here's one of those um flowery pictures you sometimes see in the cards. And there's um a willow. Is that a willow tree? [?] There's some kind of a tree in the forefront of the picture with loads of branches and lots of flowers, and I think they're flowers and leaves all over them and I think there's a stream running behind the tree. There's a little boat and on the grass kind of up on the shore and um behind the stream, bushes and little trees and more grass and more wilderness. Now, [?] because it's black and white it's quite cold. Then maybe it's the sun it's so it's quite bright. Not me favourite
